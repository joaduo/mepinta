Mepinta is a Python, C and C++ project.

Right now I am developing the script for an easy deployment.
So there is no easy installation.

Right now this software works only on Linux. (multiplatform is planned in the future)

Requirements: (for you to get an idea)
  Add python path for needed projects

  Some shared libraries that need to be compiled
  backend/c_and_cpp/backend_api_c
  backend/c_and_cpp/backend_api_cpp
  
  Compile k3d from source to get the k3dsdk.so (or alternatively getting it from the binary installer)
  
  Compile each c_and_cpp plugin (without specifying its shared libraries dependencies)
  
  Create shedkin python module: 
  core/python_core/mepinta/pipeline/lo_cpp/load_library_stand_alone.so
  from the python module:
  ./core/python_core/mepinta/pipeline/lo_cpp/load_library_stand_alone.py
  
If you are really interested in deploying mepinta contact me directly 
  joaduo at g mail 
Or you can wait until the deployment script is ready.
